Encoding the names & types as type parameters allows convenient use of the type in generated functions and other optimization use-cases, but users should note that when names and/or types are the nothing value, the names and/or types are stored in the storednames and storedtypes fields. This is to account for extremely wide tables with columns in the 10s of thousands where encoding the names/types as type parameters becomes prohibitive to the compiler.

We then iterate the rows in our table via for row in rows, and use the convenient Tables.eachcolumn to efficiently apply a function to each value in the row. Note that we didn't call Tables.columnnames or Tables.getcolumn at all, since they're utilized by Tables.eachcolumn itself. Tables.eachcolumn is optimized to provide type-stable, and even constant-propagation of column index, name, and type in some cases to allow for efficient consumption of row values.\n\nOne wrinkle to consider is the \"unknown schema\" case; i.e. what if our Tables.schema call had returned nothing (this can be the case for exotic table sources like lazily mapped transformations over rows in a table):\n\nfunction load!(sch::Nothing, rows, db::SQLite.DB, tablename)\n    # sch is nothing === unknown schema\n    # start iteration on input table rows\n    state = iterate(rows)\n    state === nothing && return\n    row, st = state\n    # query column names of first row\n    names = Tables.columnnames(row)\n    # partially construct Tables.Schema by at least passing\n    # the column names to it\n    sch = Tables.Schema(names, nothing)\n    # create table if needed\n    createtable!(db, tablename, sch)\n    # build insert statement\n    params = chop(repeat(\"?,\", length(names)))\n    stmt = Stmt(db, \"INSERT INTO $nm VALUES ($params)\")\n    # start a transaction for inserting rows\n    transaction(db) do\n        while true\n            # just like before, we can still use `Tables.eachcolumn`\n            # even with our partially constructed Tables.Schema\n            # to apply a function to each value in the row\n            Tables.eachcolumn(sch, row) do val, i, nm\n                bind!(stmt, i, val)\n            end\n            sqlite3_step(stmt.handle)\n            sqlite3_reset(stmt.handle)\n            # keep iterating rows until we finish\n            state = iterate(rows, st)\n            state === nothing && break\n            row, st = state\n        end\n    end\n    return name\nend\n\nThe strategy taken here is to start iterating the input source, and using the first row as a guide, we make a Tables.Schema object with just the column names, which we can then still pass to Tables.eachcolumn to apply our bind! function to each row value.","category":"section"},{"location":"using-the-interface/#Tables.columns-usage","page":"Using the Interface","title":"Tables.columns usage","text":"Ok, now let's take a look at a case utilizing Tables.columns.

In both cases, individual columns are collected in Vector{AbstractVector}s by calling Tables.getcolumn(x, nm) for each column name. A final note is the call to getvector on each column, which ensures each column is materialized as an AbstractVector, as is required by the DataFrame constructor.\n\nNote in both the rows and columns usages, we didn't need to worry about the natural orientation of the input data; we just called Tables.rows or Tables.columns as was most natural for the table-specific use-case, knowing that it will Just Work™️.","category":"section"},{"location":"using-the-interface/#Tables.jl-Utilities","page":"Using the Interface","title":"Tables.jl Utilities","text":"Before moving on to implementing the Tables.jl interfaces, we take a quick break to highlight some useful utility functions provided by Tables.jl:","category":"section"},{"location":"using-the-interface/#Tables.rows-using-the-interface","page":"Using the Interface","title":"Tables.rows","text":"Tables.rows(x) => Row iterator\n\nAccesses data of input table source x row-by-row by returning an AbstractRow-compatible iterator.

We also defined Tables.schema by pulling the column names out that we stored, and since AbstractVecOrMat have a single eltype, we repeat it for each column (the call to fill). Note that defining Tables.schema is optional on tables; by default, nothing is returned and Tables.jl consumers should account for both known and unknown schema cases. Returning a schema when possible allows consumers to have certain optimizations when they can know the types of all columns upfront (and if the # of columns isn't too large) to generate more efficient code.\n\nNow, in this example, we're actually going to have MatrixTable implement both Tables.rows and Tables.columns methods itself, i.e. it's going to return itself from those functions, so here's first how we make our MatrixTable a valid Tables.AbstractColumns object:\n\n# column interface\nTables.columnaccess(::Type{<:MatrixTable}) = true\nTables.columns(m::MatrixTable) = m\n# required Tables.AbstractColumns object methods\nTables.getcolumn(m::MatrixTable, ::Type{T}, col::Int, nm::Symbol) where {T} = matrix(m)[:, col]\nTables.getcolumn(m::MatrixTable, nm::Symbol) = matrix(m)[:, lookup(m)[nm]]\nTables.getcolumn(m::MatrixTable, i::Int) = matrix(m)[:, i]\nTables.columnnames(m::MatrixTable) = names(m)\n\nWe define columnaccess for our type, then columns just returns the MatrixTable itself, and then we define the three getcolumn methods and columnnames. Note the use of a lookup Dict that maps column name to column index so we can figure out which column to return from the matrix. We're also storing the column names in our names field so the columnnames implementation is trivial. And that's it! Literally! It can now be written out to a csv file, stored in a sqlite or other database, converted to DataFrame or JuliaDB table, etc. Pretty fun.\n\nAnd now for the Tables.rows implementation:\n\n# declare that any MatrixTable defines its own `Tables.rows` method\nrowaccess(::Type{<:MatrixTable}) = true\n# just return itself, which means MatrixTable must iterate `Tables.AbstractRow`-compatible objects\nrows(m::MatrixTable) = m\n# the iteration interface, at a minimum, requires `eltype`, `length`, and `iterate`\n# for `MatrixTable` `eltype`, we're going to provide a custom row type\nBase.eltype(m::MatrixTable{T}) where {T} = MatrixRow{T}\nBase.length(m::MatrixTable) = size(matrix(m), 1)\n\nBase.iterate(m::MatrixTable, st=1) = st > length(m) ? nothing : (MatrixRow(st, m), st + 1)\n\n# a custom row type; acts as a \"view\" into a row of an AbstractVecOrMat\nstruct MatrixRow{T} <: Tables.AbstractRow\n    row::Int\n    source::MatrixTable{T}\nend\n# required `Tables.AbstractRow` interface methods (same as for `Tables.AbstractColumns` object before)\n# but this time, on our custom row type\ngetcolumn(m::MatrixRow, ::Type, col::Int, nm::Symbol) =\n    getfield(getfield(m, :source), :matrix)[getfield(m, :row), col]\ngetcolumn(m::MatrixRow, i::Int) =\n    getfield(getfield(m, :source), :matrix)[getfield(m, :row), i]\ngetcolumn(m::MatrixRow, nm::Symbol) =\n    getfield(getfield(m, :source), :matrix)[getfield(m, :row), getfield(getfield(m, :source), :lookup)[nm]]\ncolumnnames(m::MatrixRow) = names(getfield(m, :source))\n\nHere we start by defining Tables.rowaccess and Tables.rows, and then the iteration interface methods, since we declared that a MatrixTable itself is an iterator of Tables.AbstractRow-compatible objects. For eltype, we say that a MatrixTable iterates our own custom row type, MatrixRow. MatrixRow subtypes Tables.AbstractRow, which provides interface implementations for several useful behaviors (indexing, iteration, property-access, etc.); essentially it makes our custom MatrixRow type more convenient to work with.\n\nImplementing the Tables.AbstractRow interface is straightforward, and very similar to our implementation of Tables.AbstractColumns previously (i.e. the same methods for getcolumn and columnnames).\n\nAnd that's it. Our MatrixTable type is now a fully fledged, valid Tables.jl source and can be used throughout the ecosystem. Now, this is obviously not a lot of code; but then again, the actual Tables.jl interface implementations tend to be fairly simple, given the other behaviors that are already defined for table types (i.e. table types tend to already have a getcolumn like function defined).","category":"section"},{"location":"implementing-the-interface/#Tables.isrowtable","page":"Implementing the Interface","title":"Tables.isrowtable","text":"One option for certain table types is to define Tables.isrowtable to automatically satisfy the Tables.jl interface.

Continuing with our MatrixTable example, let's see some useful ways to test that things are working as expected.\n\nmat = [1 4.0 \"7\"; 2 5.0 \"8\"; 3 6.0 \"9\"]\n\nFirst, we define a matrix literal with three columns of various differently typed values.\n\n# first, create a MatrixTable from our matrix input\nmattbl = Tables.table(mat)\n# test that the MatrixTable `istable`\n@test Tables.istable(typeof(mattbl))\n# test that it defines row access\n@test Tables.rowaccess(typeof(mattbl))\n@test Tables.rows(mattbl) === mattbl\n# test that it defines column access\n@test Tables.columnaccess(typeof(mattbl))\n@test Tables.columns(mattbl) === mattbl\n# test that we can access the first \"column\" of our matrix table by column name\n@test mattbl.Column1 == [1,2,3]\n# test our `Tables.AbstractColumns` interface methods\n@test Tables.getcolumn(mattbl, :Column1) == [1,2,3]\n@test Tables.getcolumn(mattbl, 1) == [1,2,3]\n@test Tables.columnnames(mattbl) == [:Column1, :Column2, :Column3]\n# now let's iterate our MatrixTable to get our first MatrixRow\nmatrow = first(mattbl)\n@test eltype(mattbl) == typeof(matrow)\n# now we can test our `Tables.AbstractRow` interface methods on our MatrixRow\n@test matrow.Column1 == 1\n@test Tables.getcolumn(matrow, :Column1) == 1\n@test Tables.getcolumn(matrow, 1) == 1\n@test propertynames(mattbl) == propertynames(matrow) == [:Column1, :Column2, :Column3]\n\nSo, it looks like our MatrixTable type is looking good. It's doing everything we'd expect with regards to accessing its rows or columns via the Tables.jl API methods. Testing a table source like this is fairly straightforward since we're really just testing that our interface methods are doing what we expect them to do.\n\nNow, while we didn't go over a \"sink\" function for matrices in our walkthrough, there does indeed exist a Tables.matrix function that allows converting any table input source into a plain Julia Matrix object.\n\nHaving both Tables.jl \"source\" and \"sink\" implementations (i.e. a type that is a Tables.jl-compatible source, as well as a way to consume other tables), allows us to do some additional \"round trip\" testing:\n\nrt = [(a=1, b=4.0, c=\"7\"), (a=2, b=5.0, c=\"8\"), (a=3, b=6.0, c=\"9\")]\nct = (a=[1,2,3], b=[4.0, 5.0, 6.0])\n\nIn addition to our mat object earlier, we can define a couple simple \"tables\"; in this case rt is a kind of default \"row table\" as a Vector of NamedTuples, while ct is a default \"column table\" as a NamedTuple of Vectors. Notice that they contain mostly the same data as our matrix literal earlier, yet in slightly different storage formats. These default \"row\" and \"column\" tables are supported by default in Tables.jl due do their natural table representations, and hence can be excellent tools in testing table integrations.\n\n# let's turn our row table into a plain Julia Matrix object\nmat = Tables.matrix(rt)\n# test that our matrix came out like we expected\n@test mat[:, 1] == [1, 2, 3]\n@test size(mat) == (3, 3)\n@test eltype(mat) == Any\n# so we successfully consumed a row-oriented table,\n# now let's try with a column-oriented table\nmat2 = Tables.matrix(ct)\n@test eltype(mat2) == Float64\n@test mat2[:, 1] == ct.a\n\n# now let's take our matrix input, and make a column table out of it\ntbl = Tables.table(mat) |> columntable\n@test keys(tbl) == (:Column1, :Column2, :Column3)\n@test tbl.Column1 == [1, 2, 3]\n# and same for a row table\ntbl2 = Tables.table(mat2) |> rowtable\n@test length(tbl2) == 3\n@test map(x->x.Column1, tbl2) == [1.0, 2.0, 3.0]","category":"section"},{"location":"implementing-the-interface/#Tables.AbstractRow-implementing-the-interface","page":"Implementing the Interface","title":"Tables.AbstractRow","text":"Tables.AbstractRow\n\nAbstract interface type representing the expected eltype of the iterator returned from Tables.rows(table).
